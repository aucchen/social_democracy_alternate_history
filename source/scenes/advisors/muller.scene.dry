@coalition
title: Negotiating with the Coalition
subtitle: Müller can improve our relationships with our coalition partners.
choose-if: advisor_action_timer <= 0 and spd_in_government = 1
unavailable-subtitle: [? if advisor_action_timer > 0 : [+ advisor_action_timer +] months before next advisor action. ?][? if not spd_in_government: The SPD is not in government. ?]
on-arrival: advisor_action_timer = 6; coalition_dissent -= 1 if spd_in_government = 1; z_relation += 5; ddp_relation += 5; dvp_relation += 5

We have improved our relations with the Z, DDP, and DVP, and reduced tensions with the coalition.


@toleration

unavailable-subtitle: [? if advisor_action_timer > 0 : [+ advisor_action_timer +] months before next advisor action. ?][? if not spd_toleration: The SPD is not in toleration. ?]
choose-if: spd_in_government = 0 and spd_toleration = 1 and advisor_action_timer = 0
on-arrival: advisor_action_timer = 6; left_dissent -= 8; neorevisionist_dissent -= 8; center_dissent -= 5;

We have called for new elections, set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
