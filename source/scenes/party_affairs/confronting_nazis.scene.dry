# Forming the Iron Front

The Nazis' strength is gaining, as shown by their recent election results and their violent presence in the streets. Their fascism threatens to plunge Germany once again into the abyss.

Many in our party are calling for urgent action. The "neorevisionist" faction, led by young socialists like Carlo Mierendorff and Julius Leber, have formed specifically around this cause. But many in all factions of the party are calling for action.

The Nazis are just another far-right movement that will die of its own contradictions sooner or later; we do not need to build a specific policy to combat them.

The Nazis are one of the foremost threats to the German republic. However, we are still formulating a strategy to confront them, and still trying to build up consensus within our party for action. Check back on this later.

The Nazi threat can no longer be ignored. We must build a new organization to confront them - the Iron Front - consisting of the SPD, the ADGB trade union federation, and the *Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold*. We have a new symbol - the Three Arrows, pointing down towards the left.

What do the three arrows stand for?

- @unity: Unity, Activity, and Discipline.
- @anti: Opposition to Fascism, Stalinism, and Monarchism.
- @orgs: The SPD, ADGB, and Reichsbanner.
- @wtb: Woytinsky, Tarnow, and Baade of the WTB-Plan
- @all: All of the above.

@unity

The Iron Front has given a new energy to our party.
