= Questions of Ideology

The SPD is torn between many different ideological currents. What should be our primary ideological guidance for now?

[? if ideology != 0 : We have previously chosen a [+ ideology +] ideology. Changing it will likely have drawbacks. ?]

- @class_struggle: Class struggle and preparing the proletariat for the revolution are our primary goals.
- @centrist: The Center Marxism of Karl Kautsky remains the best way to resolve our internal contradictions.
- @labor: We should work with the trade unions to improve the lives of workers.
- @reform: Following Eduard Bernstein, we should work for ethical socialism, strengthen democracy, and expand the party's electorate.
- @easy_discard

go-to: changed if changed = 1
on-departure: ideology = "left"; left_strength += 10; communist_coalition += 1; left_dissent -= 5; z_relation -= 3; dvp_relation -= 5; nationalization_support += 1; kpd_relation += 3

The radical left of the party supports a course of class struggle, and potentially a reconcilliation with the Communists.

@centrist
on-arrival: {!
if (Q.ideology && Q.ideology != "centrist") {
    Q.changed = 1;
}
!}
go-to: changed if changed = 1
on-departure: ideology = "centrist"; center_strength += 10; center_dissent -= 10

The Center Marxists, represented by Kautsky and Hilferding, support a middle course of preparing for revolution while building up the consciousness of the working class.

@labor
on-arrival: {!
if (Q.ideology && Q.ideology != "labor") {
    Q.changed = 1;
}
!}
go-to: changed if changed = 1
on-departure: ideology = "labor"; labor_strength += 10; wtb_support += 1; labor_dissent -= 5; kpd_relation -= 3

The labor wing of the party supports continued particpation in government in order to provide benefits to the workers, and the creation of public works programs for employment.

@reform
on-arrival: {!
if (Q.ideology && Q.ideology != "reformist") {
    Q.changed = 1;
}
!}
go-to: changed if changed = 1
on-departure: ideology = "reformist"; reformist_strength += 10; democratization += 1; reformist_dissent -= 5; z_relation += 5; dvp_relation += 5; kpd_relation -= 8

The reformist wing of the party seeks to preserve the Republic and the democratic system of government, and is most supportive of coalitions with the other pro-democracy parties.

@changed
on-arrival: left_dissent += 5; center_dissent += 5; labor_dissent += 5; reformist_dissent += 5

We have changed ideologies. Many in the party feel unmoored.
