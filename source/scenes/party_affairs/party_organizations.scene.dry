= Party Organizations

In addition to being a political party, the SPD is a social world onto itself, with a vast array of associated organizations which serve the social needs of their members from cradle to grave.

- @newspapers: Fund more newspapers and journalists.
- @welfare: Fund more mutual aid and welfare programs.
- @culture: Fund sports leagues, educational, and cultural programs.
- @rb: Fund the Reichsbanner, our self-defense organization.
- @youth: We have the reputation of being a party for old men. Support the youth organizations.
- @nothing: Do not increase funding for any program.

# TODO: differing outcomes based on whether you've seen media, and what kind of media you've supported.


@welfare
choose-if: resources > 0

subtitle: -1 resources
on-arrival: resources -= 1; workers_aid += 1; unemployed_spd += 5*(1 - dissent);

We have increased funding to Workers' Welfare. [? if black_thursday_seen > 0 : In an age of economic crisis, this will be helpful for improving our standing among the unemployed. ?]

@culture

on-arrival: resources -= 1; cultural_organizations += 1; left_dissent -= 6; center_dissent -= 6; labor_dissent -= 6; reformist_dissent -= 6; neorevisionist_dissent -= 6

It is not enough for the SPD to solely be a political party. The Worker Singer's League, Worker's Sports, and our schools and libraries are crucial to our members' lives. Funding these organizations makes our members more committed to the party, even when our policies might not be to their liking.

[? if sa_strength > 500 : However, it feels frivolous to spend on sports and choirs when the fascists are murdering us in the streets. ?]

@rb

subtitle: -1 resources
on-arrival: resources -= 1; rb_strength  += 100; rb_militancy += 0.01; reichsbanner_timer = 0; funded_reichsbanner += 1

We have increased recruiting to the Reichsbanner.

@youth

on-arrival: resources -= 1; rb_strength += 50; rb_militancy += 0.02; young_socialists += 1; left_strength += 5; neorevisionist_strength += 5; radicalization += 1;

Our new youth members flock to the left or neorevisionist wings of the party, and also bring new radicalism to the Reichsbanner.

@nothing

We do not fund any party organizations.

- @return: Continue...
