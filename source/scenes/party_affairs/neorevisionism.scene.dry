= Neorevisionism: A New Idea

Several young socialists, led by Carlo Mierendorff, are calling for a "new revisionism" in response to the Nazi threat. This political tendency calls for a mass movement in favor of democracy in order to counter the Nazi and Communist movements, and to update our rhetoric and imagery to appeal to emotion and not just reason.

#- @shuffle_leadership: It's time to change our advisors to take into account new ideas.
- @support_neo: Support the neorevisionist movement.
- @no_new_ideas: We don't need new ideas.
- @easy_discard

@support_neo
on-arrival: neorevisionist_strength += 10; nazi_urgency += 1; neorevisionism = 1; peoples_party_support += 1

We support the new leaders, and start using new-style propaganda techniques in our campaigns. The results are uncertain so far...

- @shuffle_leadership: We should use this opportunity to change the party's leadership.
- @root: Continue...


@no_new_ideas
on-arrival: neorevisionist_strength -= 5; center_strength += 5; neorevisionism = -1

We do not need these new ideas; they seem to imitate too closely those of the Nazis and Communists.
