#subtitle: Building ties with our fraternal socialist parties.

At the Labor and Socialist International, we can forge contacts with our fraternal socialist parties in Europe and across the world.

- @fr_uk: Build relationships with the French SFIO and British Labour Party to move their governments in Germany's favor.
- @austria: Learn organization and street fighting from the Austrian socialists.
- @scandi: Learn the path of economics and reform from the Scandinavian social democrats.
- @comintern: Forget the second international - embed a spy in the Comintern's conference.
- @america: Contact the Socialist party of America.
- @return: We do not need international contacts at the moment.
- @easy_discard
- @cancel_advisor_action

The socialists of France and Britain can influence their governments to be friendlier towards Germany. Hopefully they will reduce our reparations burden.

Our Reichsbanner can learn much in paramilitary organization and training from the Austrian Republican Protection Units.

The programs of the Nordic socialists involve active government intervention in the economy. We can learn from their economic strategies, and how they moved beyond their working-class base to attract a broader set of constituents.

The Stalinists of the KPD insists on calling us "social fascists", suggesting that we social democrats are as bad or worse than actual fascists. Needless to say, this is not good for our relationship with the Communists. By observing the Comintern, we can better understand the KPD, enabling us to potentially improve relations, or counter the KPD if it may come to that.

The Socialist Party of America is tiny and has limited support. There is not much we can do for them, and conversely, not much they can do for us.

@reduce

We do not need the international contacts at the moment.
