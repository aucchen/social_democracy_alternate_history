#subtitle: Major changes to government.

# technically you could do some trickery to get a 2/3 quorum in the Reichstag by stopping some people from attending... if the NSDAP is boycotting the Reichstag, or if the NSDAP or DNVP are banned in the aftermath of a coup atempt...

# alternatively, a constitutional referendum can be initiated, that requires a simple majority of voters to pass (as I understand article 76). This should depend on support for the republic and for democracy, and the relationships with the other parties (more similar to the presidential election).

= Constitutional Reform

# the ideas for constitutional reform here are based on the bundesrepublik basic law... I'm not sure if it's totally realistic to what someone like Mierendorff would've wanted.

Many neorevisionists consider the Weimar Constitution to be inadequate. They believe that the clauses of the constitution are in part responsible for the instability of the country, and must change in order to build a more stable democratic republic. Ideas from both socialists and liberals

A constitutional reform requires either a two-thirds supermajority in the Reichstag, or a constitutional referendum with support from a majority of the electorate. If we do not have a supermajority in the Reichstag, we must be assured of strong support from the other parties for the constitutional referendum.

# The left is opposed to this.

Some political thinkers believe that the proliferation of minor parties is responsible for the instability of the republic. They believe that a higher electoral threshold will reduce the influence of small radical parties. Parties that win a plurality in a constituency will maintain their representation, a gift to regional parties such as the BVP. 

The smaller parties will obviously oppose this reform. [? if z_relation > 30 : The Center Party supports this reform, while their BVP partners oppose it. ?] [? if kpd_relation > 50 and kpd_normalized >= 0.1 : Perhaps surprisingly, the KPD supports this reform. ?] [? if nsdap_normalized >= 0.2 : The NSDAP supports this reform, as they believe they have something to gain. ?]

The SPD Left opposes this change, as they believe it to be anti-democratic.

# this should result in a redistribution of votes - other parties should not get so many votes anymore. maybe ddp and dvp get a recovery of middle-class votes? or maybe they flow to the others.

We have passed a constitutional amendment to increase the electoral threshold to 5%. This is likely to benefit the larger parties and harm the smaller ones.

We have successfully passed a constitutional amendment to ban votes of no confidence when a new government cannot be formed. Hopefully this increases the stability of our governments.

The wide-ranging presidential powers promised by the constitution are a potential gateway to authoritarianism. Thus, we can support reforms that limit the powers of the president, ending his power to unilaterally terminate an elected government and to remove state governments.

The KPD is in favor of this reform, having been victims of the *Reichsexekution* in the past (when KPD-supported state governments in Thuringia and Saxony were removed). The democrats of the [+ ddp_name +] also support this. [? if president == "Hindenburg": However, the opposition from conservatives is vehement, as they see a reduction in presidential powers as disrespectful to Hindenburg. ?] [? if z_relation <= 49 and president == "Hindenburg" : Thus, the Center Party has been influenced to oppose these reforms. ?] [? if z_relation > 49 and president == "Hindenburg" : Despite this, the Center Party supports the proposed reform. ?] [? if president == "Braun" : The Center Party supports this reform. ?]
