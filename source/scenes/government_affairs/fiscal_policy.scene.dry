= Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy involves issues of taxation and budget.

- @raise_progressive: Make the tax system more progressive by raising taxes on the rich and cutting them for the poor.
- @raise_rich: Increase taxes on the rich.
- @raise_overall: Increase overall taxes.
- @cut_overall: Cut overall taxes.
- @regressive
- @root: Do not change the tax system.
- @easy_discard

@raise_progressive
subtitle: This does not change overall revenue.
on-arrival: workers_spd += 6*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd -= 3; new_middle_spd -= 3; coalition_dissent += 1 if in_grand_coalition; dvp_relation -= 4; finance_goal_completed += 1; upper_tax_rates += 1; lower_tax_rates -= 1; capital_strike_progress += 1; capital_strike_progress += 1 if upper_tax_rates > 1; capital_strike_progress += 1 if upper_tax_rates > 3;

Making the tax system more progressive is popular among our base, but it upsets our bourgeois coalition partners, as well as our minimal number of bourgeois voters.

@raise_rich
subtitle: +2 budget
on-arrival: upper_tax_rates += 1; capital_strike_progress += 1; capital_strike_progress += 1 if upper_tax_rates > 1; capital_strike_progress += 1 if upper_tax_rates > 3; workers_spd += 4*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd -= 4; new_middle_spd -= 4; coalition_dissent += 1 if in_grand_coalition; coalition_dissent += 1 if capital_strike_progress >= 5; budget += 2; dvp_relation -= 4; unemployed += 1; finance_goal_completed += 1; inflation -= 0.6

Raising taxes on the rich is popular among our base, but it alienates the bourgeoisie. Increasing taxes also decreases economic demand, which may lead to more unemployment.

@cut_overall
subtitle: -2 budget
choose-if: budget >= 2
on-arrival: budget -= 2; upper_tax_rates -= 1; lower_tax_rates -= 1; new_middle_spd += 5*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 4*(1-dissent); workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent); dvp_relation += 5*(1-dissent); z_relation += 5*(1-dissent); unemployed -= 1 if unemployed >= 5; capital_strike_progress -= 1 if upper_tax_rates < 0; inflation += 0.4

Cutting taxes benefits most the rich and middle-class, who pay more taxes than the working class. Our coalition partners are happy at our orthodox economic course.

@raise_overall
subtitle: +3 budget
on-arrival: budget += 3; new_middle_spd -= 4; old_middle_spd -= 4; workers_spd -= 3; rural_spd -= 3; unemployed += 2; kpd_coalition_dissent += 1; lower_tax_rates += 1; upper_tax_rates += 1; capital_strike_progress += 1 if upper_tax_rates > 1; capital_strike_progress += 1 if upper_tax_rates > 2; workers_spd -= 5 if lower_tax_rates > 1; inflation -= 1.1

Raising taxes hurts our support among all those who pay taxes. [? if in_grand_coalition or in_weimar_coalition : However, our coalition partners are more supportive of the idea of "shared sacrifice" than simply taxing the rich. ?] Increasing taxes also decreases economic demand, which may lead to more unemployment.

@regressive
title: Lower taxes on the rich, while increasing consumption taxes (which affect the working class more).
subtitle: This does not change overall revenue.
on-arrival: workers_spd -= 6; new_middle_spd += 5*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 4*(1-dissent); dvp_relation += 5; z_relation += 4; coalition_dissent -= 1; kpd_coalition_dissent += 1; upper_tax_rates -= 1; lower_tax_rates += 1; workers_spd -= 5 if lower_tax_rates >= 2; capital_strike_progress -= 1 if upper_tax_rates < 0

Our regressive taxation policy benefits the rich while hurting the poor and working-class. Our bourgeois coalition partners approve of this orthodox economic course.
