= Internal Security

The Interior Ministry controls internal security throughout the German Republic. While most police work is delegated to the states, the national security agency can perform special investigations.

As with the state police units and the Reichswehr, the internal police tends to be reactionary, and has serious issues with loyalty to the elected government of the Republic.

- @loyalty: Improve the loyalty of the Interior Ministry forces.
- @investigate_corruption: Investigate corruption by big businesses.
- @investigate_far_right: Investigate illegal activity among the far right.
- @domestic_enemies: Investigate or ban our domestic enemies.
- @deport_hitler
- @root: Take no action for now.

@loyalty
on-arrival: interior_police_loyalty += 0.1

As with the Prussian state police, there are measures we can take to root out reactionary and anti-democratic sentiment in the police. We can improve training and recruiting procedures, and identify and remove known fascists and the like.

Current interior police loyalty: [+ interior_police_loyalty : loyalty +]

@investigate_corruption_success
on-arrival: investigate_corruption += 1; workers_spd += 5*(1-dissent);

Corruption in big business is rampant, of course. We have uncovered a number of scandals, and publicizing them brings new attention to the work of Interior Minister [+ interior_minister +], building up his popular appeal and that of the SPD.


@investigate_corruption_failure

Unfortunately, our investigations have failed to turn up anything. Rumors are that the targets of our investigation were tipped off by infiltrators within the police.

[? if investigate_far_right == 1 : We have discovered collusion between Hjalmar Schacht, president of the Reichsbank, and the Nazis. This is very useful information. ?]
[? if investigate_far_right == 2 : We have discovered illegal arms smuggling by the SA, the Nazi paramilitary. ?]
[? if investigate_far_right == 3 : We have discovered a secret cache of documents from the NSDAP detailing their plan to violently take over the country if they enter into power. This is an anti-constitutional plot, and will be publicized and persecuted. ?]
[? if investigate_far_right > 3 : Of course the Nazis are doing crimes; everyone knows that. Now, we finally have proof. ?]
