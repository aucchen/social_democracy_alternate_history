Our spending on public works has resulted in a lower need for unemployment insurance and welfare, and increased tax receipts through the multiplier effect as the new money courses through the economy, recuperating some of our spending. We continue to invest most of the new revenue into the program.

The economy is doing better, finally. Even the bourgeois parties are beginning to see the light.

@nationalize_deficit

Unfortunately, we do not have the budget to begin buying out industrial facilities. Some are urging for deficit spending in order to purchase factories, while others are encouraging (currently illegal) factory takeovers by workers, or nationalization without compensation. Taking any of these actions would require a vast departure from our previous party stances.

The capitalists are, predictably, up in arms about our policy of nationalization without compensation. They call it illegal expropriation, and it is. Nevertheless, it is clear that they have failed by keeping their factories idle, and we must take radical action.

Fascists have been taking increasingly violent actions around the occupied factories, calling us thieves and looters. However, the some of the working-class supporters of the fascists have been peeled off, or at least the ones with a sense of class solidarity.
