@improve_west
title: Improve our relations with the Western Allies.
on-arrival: west_relation += 2; reparations_negotiation += 1

The key to peace in Europe is a rapproachment between France and Germany. We are taking steps towards that rapproachment. [? if young_plan_seen == 0 : This is difficult to do when France is occupying a major portion of Germany's territory, but we are working on that part. ?]

@improve_east
title: Improve our relations with our eastern neighbors.
on-arrival: east_relation += 2;

We also aim to improve relations with our eastern neighbors, Poland and Czechoslovakia, who are righfully terrified of German aggression. Hopefully we can convince them of our peaceful intentions.

@improve_soviet
title: Improve our relations with the Soviet Union.
subtitle: We could also broach the question of the KPD...

The Soviet Union also suffered from the international order created by the Treaty of Versailles; they have been participating in our secret rearmament program. The Treaty of Rapallo in 1922 affirmed our friendly relations.

The Soviets are asking for economic and developmental assistance. They are still a poor country on the whole, and are desperately trying to catch up to the western powers. There is a chance that our anti-communist coalition partners would be upset, but we could assuage them by asking the Soviets for secret assistance in training and equiping the Reichswehr.

- @soviet_economic_aid_yes_mil: Provide aid, in exchange for Reichswehr assistance.
- @soviet_economic_aid_yes: Provide aid, in exchange for only good relations.
- @soviet_economic_aid_no: Don't provide aid.

The Soviets are pleased that we have sent them aid, and have agreed to help train our military. The Reichswehr appreciates our support.

@soviet_economic_aid_yes
choose-if: budget >= 1
subtitle: -1 budget
on-arrival: budget -= 1; soviet_relation += 2; coalition_dissent += 1; foreign_goal_completed += 1

The Soviets are pleased that we have sent them aid, and have not asked for anything specific in exchange. Our coalition partners are less pleased.

- @kpd: Ask if Moscow could help repair our relations with the KPD.
- @root: Do not mention the KPD.

@soviet_economic_aid_no

The Soviets are slightly upset, but they seemed to expect this answer.


@kpd
on-arrival: kpd_relation += 8*(1-dissent); communist_coalition += 1 if kpd_foreign_seen == 0; kpd_foreign_seen = 1

We also mention the KPD in our conversations with the Soviet ambassador. They claim that the KPD is entirely independent of the Soviet government, and that the conflict is ThÃ¤lmann's doing. But, soon after our conversation we notice a slight improvement in attitudes from the KPD.


@customs_union
title: Form a customs union with Austria?
subtitle: This will likely incur the wrath of France.
unavailable-subtitle: This is superseded by the European Union.
choose-if: eu = 0
view-if: black_thursday_seen = 1 and customs_union = 0

The right has long desired closer ties with Austria, with the eventual goal of the merger of the two German-speaking countries. A customs union with Austria is the first step towards this goal. Additionally, many believe that a union with Austria would improve our current economic circumstances.

However, the Allies, especially France, are likely to object. This agreement would break the terms of the Versailles Treaty, and could lead to economic sanctions, further hurting our economy.

- @customs_union_2: Yes, do it!
- @fp_menu: No, we should do something else.

@customs_union_2
on-arrival: banking_crisis_timer = 2; customs_union = 1; west_relation -= 2; east_relation -= 2; z_relation += 6; dvp_relation += 6; coalition_dissent -= 1; coup_progress -= 1
max-visits: 1

We have formed a customs union with Austria! The right-wing parties are praising us for this unexpected turn of events.

Immediately, France and other neighboring countries lodge their protests. The longer-term response is yet to be seen.


@negotiate
title: Negotiate regarding our remaining obligations from the Treaty of Versailles.
subtitle: [? if young_plan_seen == 1 : After passing the Young Plan, France has committed to withdrawing from the Rhineland. Now, we must see if they can reduce our reparations further, given the economic depression. ?]

on-arrival: west_relation += 1; reparations_negotiation += 1; reparations_negotiation += 1 if pacifism >= 3; reparations_negotiations += 1 if nationalism <= 50; reparations_negotiation += 1 if west_relation >= 3

Negotiations procede smoothly for the most part. The Western powers are convinced of Germany's sincerity and goodwill. [? if nationalism <= 50 or pacifism >= 3 : They are pleased to see that we are renouncing militarism. ?]


@reduce_reparations
title: The Western Allies are finally willing to pause our reparations payments!
subtitle: Our negotiations have been successful.
view-if: reparations_negotiation >= 3 and black_thursday_seen == 1 and reparations > -2
on-arrival: west_relation += 1; reparations = -2; budget += 2 if hoover_memorandum_seen == 0; budget += 1 if hoover_memorandum_seen == 1; coalition_dissent -= 1; workers_spd += 8*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 5*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd += 5*(1-dissent); rural_spd += 5*(1-dissent); coup_progress -= 2 if coup_progress > 2
max-visits: 1

Finally, given both the economic circumstances and our continued negotiations, the Western Allies are willing to pause our reparations payments! Much of the credit must go to American president Hoover, who has been friendlier towards us than the Europeans.

This has reduced tensions within our government, and our party has gotten credit for the achievement.

@expose
title: Expose the secret rearmament plans of the previous foreign ministry!
view-if: rearmament_exposed == 0
on-arrival: west_relation += 2; east_relation += 1; nationalism -= 5*(1-dissent); pro_republic += 5*(1-dissent); coalition_dissent += 1; rearmament_exposed += 1; reparations_negotiation += 3; coup_progress += 2

The previous foreign ministry, despite its benevolent and peaceful face, was secretly helping the Reichswehr to build up its forces, in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles.

The Allies are grateful of our exposure and repudiation of militarism. Our partners in the coalition are less supportive.


@economic_conference

on-arrival: reichskonkordat_progress += 2; reichskonkordat_progress -= 1 if abortion_rights; reichskonkordat_progress -= 1 if family_law; z_relation += 3

The Roman Catholic Church is interested in furthering relations with the German Republic, seeing us as preferable to the old anti-Catholic policies of the Empire. We are working towards the signing of a Concordat, an agreement between the Vatican and the Republic that formally recognizes the Church's rights and interests in the country. The Center Party is especially interested in making this agreement.

[? if family_law : Our liberalized divorce policies make it difficult to build relations with the Vatican. ?] [? if abortion : Our legalization of abortion make it difficult to connect with the Church. ?]

achievement: reichskonkordat

We have successfully signed a Concordat between Germany and the Roman Catholic Church! This treaty defines a formal relationship between the Church and the German state, guaranteeing freedom of worship for Catholics, and the right of the church to appoint their own clergy. Catholics in Germany are pleased, as are their representatives in the Center Party.

on-arrival: eu_progress += 1; west_relation += 1

Forming a "United States of Europe" has long been part of the Social Democratic foreign program. Finally, we are taking steps towards it. Given our positive relations with the other countries of Europe, we can begin to hold multilateral negotiations for more European federalism. It will take time to hammer out the exact shape of this future "European Union", however.

max-visits: 1
achievement: eu

Along with France, Great Britain, and many other states of Western and Eastern Europe, we have signed a treaty to form a European Union! It is hoped that Europe has learned the lessons of the Great War; never again will there be another war that tears the continent apart.

A major component of the union is the free movement of people and goods across the countries of Europe, as well as the stabilization of currency exchange rates. This provides new markets for German products and new sources of investment.

Fascist Italy remains a problem, and the Soviet Union also lies outside the system. But for now, there is new hope for peace and prosperity throughout the continent.
