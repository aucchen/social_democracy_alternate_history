Is it really that simple? Won't his supporters react violently to this suggestion? And even if the deportation does succeed, won't he just re-enter the country, or perhaps organize from Austria? And, some people consider this to be an anti-democratic abuse of power, using the law in order to target a political opponent.

- @deport: Deport him!
- @no_deport: No, we must not.

@deport_violence

When the police approach, he is surrounded by his SA guards, preventing him from being extricated! We can attempt to force a confrontation, but that may have negative consequences. The Reichsbanner may also attempt to draw off the SA.

- @force_approach: Force the approach!
- @no_deport: Cancel the deportation.

Unfortunately, our forces fail to disloge the SA from their positions surrounding Hitler. He is seen as both a strong and powerful leader and a victim, further reinforcing his image. The Nazis are left stronger than ever.

The confrontation ends with the police and Reichsbanner prevailing, capturing Hitler so he can be deported! This is a sign of weakness, and his physical distance makes organizing difficult, impeding the Nazi effort to win more votes.

In Hitler's absence, Joseph Goebbels has become the temporary leader of the Nazi party, with substantial influence from Hermann GÃ¶ring.

@deport_success
on-arrival: hitler_deported = 1; sa_strength = sa_strength/2; workers_nsdap -= 10; new_middle_nsdap -= 10; old_middle_nsdap -= 10; rural_nsdap -= 10; unemployed_nsdap -= 10; nsdap_relation -= 15
achievement: deport_hitler

Somehow, the plan worked! There was minimal resistance to Hitler's deportation. This is a sign of weakness, and his physical distance makes organizing difficult, impeding the Nazi effort to win more votes.

@no_deport
go-to: root

We will not be deporting Hitler.
