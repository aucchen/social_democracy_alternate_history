= Prussian Affairs

Prussia, by far the largest and most important state in Germany, is governed by our party, in a coalition with the Center and Democratic parties. It is the most stable and democratic state government in Germany, led by the able Otto Braun.

We can enact policies in Prussia.

- @police_loyalty: Bolster the loyalty of the police.
- @police_strength: Recruit additional police.
- @bureaucracy: Purge the bureaucracy of reactionary elements.
- @ban_sa: Ban the SA, the Nazi paramilitary group.
- @unban_sa: Reverse the SA ban.
- @ban_rfb: Ban the RFB, the Communist paramilitary.
- @unban_rfb: Reverse the RFB ban.
- @ban_sh: Ban the Stahlhelm, the Nationalist paramilitary.
- @unban_sh: Reverse the Stahlhelm ban.
- @negotiate_concordat: Negotiate a concordat with the Vatican.
- @sign_concordat: Sign a concordat with the Vatican.
- @root: No new policies are needed.
- @easy_discard

# increase police loyalty
The police have historically been overrun with reactionaries, and we are trying to change this, little by little. We have improved the training and recruitment process to select for a broader demographic than the traditional conservatives, and to put a tighter leash on their political activity. In addition, we set up committees to investigate the ranks of the police and remove those with far-right sympathies. It is a slow and arduous work.

Current police loyalty: [+ prussian_police_loyalty : loyalty +].

@police_strength
on-arrival: prussian_police_strength += 20

We have increased the size of the Prussian police.

@bureaucracy
on-arrival: prussian_police_loyalty += 0.05; nationalism -= 5; pacifism += 1; democratization += 1; pro_republic += 3*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if democratization >= 3; new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if democratization >= 4; coup_progress += 0.5

The bureaucracy is deeply reactionary, and many abuse their power to favor the political right. By removing the pro-monarchy and pro-dictatorship elements, we can democratize it. Some of our opponents claim that we are infringing on individual freedoms, but perhaps the security of the republic requires it.

@ban_sa
view-if: nazi_urgency >= 3 and sa_banned == 0
on-arrival: sa_strength *= 0.9; sa_strength *= 0.75 if prussian_police_loyalty >= 0.75; sa_banned = 1; dvp_relation -= 3; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.05; sa_militancy -= 0.05; sa_ban_timer = 6;

As it turns out, the Nazi SA has many allies in the police and bureaucracy. Our relationship with the police weakens, and the SA can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses. [? if prussian_police_loyalty >= 0.7 : Nevertheless, the SA is substantially weakend by our ban. ?] 

@unban_sa
view-if: sa_banned = 1
on-arrival: sa_banned = 0; sa_strength += 100; sa_militancy += 0.05

The SA is no longer banned. They immediately go on a recruiting spree.

@ban_sh
on-arrival: sh_strength *= 0.85; sh_strength *= 0.7 if prussian_police_loyalty >= 0.75; sh_banned = 1; dvp_relation -= 5; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.1; coalition_dissent += 1 if spd_in_government = 1 and in_grand_coalition = 1 and president = "Hindenburg"; sh_ban_timer = 6;
view-if: sh_banned == 0

[? if president == "Hindenburg": Banning the Stahlhelm weakens our relationship with President Hindenburg, as well as the political right and the police. ?][? if president != "Hindenburg": Banning the Stahlhelm weakens our relationship with the political right and the police. ?] [? if spd_in_government = 1 and in_grand_coalition = 1 and president = "Hindenburg" : It also weakens our coalition due to the influence of Hindenburg on the right wing of our coalition. ?] In addition, the Stahlhelm still operates out of public sight. 

@unban_sh
view-if: sh_banned = 1
on-arrival: sh_banned = 0; sh_strength += 100

The Stahlhelm is no longer banned.


@ban_rfb

The ban is enthusiastically carried out by the police, perhaps too enthusiastically. The Communists take this as one more reason why the Socialists are traitors to the left. However, the moderate and center-right parties approve, as do the police.

@unban_rfb
view-if: rfb_banned = 1
on-arrival: rfb_banned = 0; rfb_strength += 50; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.1

The Communist RFB is no longer banned.
