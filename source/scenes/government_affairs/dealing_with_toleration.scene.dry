= Dealing with Toleration

We are currently acting as external support to the government of Chancellor [+ chancellor +]. How should we use our position?

- @break_toleration
- @urge_against_austerity
- @improve_relations
- @new_grand_coalition
- @stay_course: Stay the course, for stability's sake.

@break_toleration
title: End the toleration agreement with a vote of no confidence!

Are we sure about this? A vote of no confidence would trigger new elections, and potentially an increased vote-share for the extremist parties.

- @vonc: Yes, end this arrangement!
- @stay_course: No, we should stay the course.

We have called for a vote of no confidence, and have brought down this government. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] currently rules as acting chancellor.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

@urge_against_austerity
title: Urge the coalition against austerity politics, and to increase social spending.
choose-if: budget >= 1
unavailable-subtitle: This can only happen with a budget surplus.
go-to: urge_success if dvp_relation >= 30 and z_relation >= 40; urge_failure if dvp_relation < 30 or z_relation < 40

@urge_success
on-arrival: welfare += 1; budget -= 1; workers_spd += 5*(1-dissent); unemployed_spd += 5*(1-dissent); z_relation -= 3; dvp_relation -= 3; reformist_dissent -= 5; center_dissent -= 5; labor_dissent -= 5;

We have successfully urged the coalition parties to increase social spending! Unfortunately, the center-right parties increasingly see us as a nuisance, and might not wish to continue these negotiations.

@urge_failure
on-arrival: z_relation -= 3; dvp_relation -= 3

Unfortunately, our negotiations have met with failure. The center-right parties increasingly see us as a nuisance, and might not wish to continue these negotiations.


@improve_relations
title: Improve relations with the parties of the coalition.
on-arrival: z_relation += 5*(1-dissent); dvp_relation += 4*(1-dissent); left_dissent += 5;

We have increased our level of contact and discussions with the parties of the coalition, primarily the Center Party and DVP.

Our attempts to reach out to the center-right are met with disdain by leftists within our party.




@new_grand_coalition
title: Can we join the government in a new grand coalition?
view-if: neo_weimar_coalition >= 50
choose-if: z_relation >= 50 and dvp_relation >= 30 and resources >= 2

on-arrival: resources -= 2; spd_in_government = 1; in_grand_coalition = 1; spd_toleration = 0; left_dissent += 6; reformist_strength += 5; leverage = 20 if leverage >= 20
achievement: constitutional_coalition

Our negotiations have succeeded, and the Center Party and DVP have agreed to form a new coalition government with us!

We are now part of a "constitutional coalition" government that includes all parties except the extremists of the KPD, DNVP, and NSDAP. [+ chancellor +] will remain as chancellor. Leftists in our party are skeptical of this arrangement.

- @election_1928.ministries: Now, we must select our ministries.



@stay_course

We will stay the course of toleration, for the sake of stability.
