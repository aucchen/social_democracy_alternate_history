= Economic Democracy

A key part of the social democratic platform is that workers should have more control over the economy. This can be done either directly at the enterprise level, by giving works councils greater influence over management, or indirectly via the democratic government, by acquiring key industries from the capitalist class and placing them under democratic control.

As we control the Labor [? if economic_minister_party == "SPD" : and Economic ?][? if finance_minister_party == "SPD" : and Finance ?] ministries, we can finally begin to implement our long-standing goals. [? if in_grand_coalition: Our bourgeois coalition partners might not agree, however. ?]

The works councils, elected by workers at each major business, have been in place since the German Revolution of 1918, but they have been largely powerless in the face of capital. Now, we will have worker representation on the boards of companies, giving them more influence in management decisions.

National and sectorial workers councils have been part of the Weimar Constitution, but they were disempowered in the past, acting as nothing more than advisory bodies. We can change that.


@expand_councils_3
title: Empower sectorial works councils.

Sectorial works councils can now negotiate wage and price policies for entire economic sectors, helping to both give workers more of a voice, and to rationalize the economy, smoothing over the anarchy of the market.

We have begun to socialize key industries by buying out the capitalist owners, and creating coordinated governing boards consisting of worker, consumer, and state representatives. The capitalists are not pleased at our intrusion into the economy.

@cooperatives_1

subtitle: -1 budget

We have enacted legislation that makes it easier to create cooperative enterprises of all sorts, and provide financial support to struggling cooperatives.
