= Investigating Domestic Enemies

As we have control over the Interior Ministry, we can direct police and intelligence services to investigate internal enemies. We can proscribe various organizations.

- @deport_hitler
- @ban_sa: Ban the SA.
- @unban_sa: Unban the SA.
- @ban_sh: Ban the Stahlhelm.
- @unban_sh: Unban the Stahlhelm.
- @ban_rfb: Ban the Communist RFB.
- @unban_rfb: Unban the RFB.
- @root: Take no action for now.

@ban_sa
view-if: nazi_urgency >= 3 and sa_banned == 0
on-arrival: sa_strength *= 0.85; sa_strength *= 0.7 if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.7; sa_banned = 1; dvp_relation -= 3; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.05; sa_militancy -= 0.05; sa_ban_timer = 6;

As it turns out, the Nazi SA has many allies in the police and bureaucracy. Our relationship with the police weakens, and the SA can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses. [? if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.7 : Nevertheless, the SA is substantially weakend by our ban. ?]

@unban_sa
view-if: sa_banned = 1
on-arrival: sa_banned = 0; sa_strength += 100; sa_militancy += 0.05

The SA is no longer banned. They immediately go on a recruiting spree.

@ban_sh
on-arrival: sh_strength *= 0.85; sh_strength *= 0.7 if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.7; sh_banned = 1; dvp_relation -= 5; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.1; coalition_dissent += 1 if spd_in_government = 1 and in_grand_coalition = 1 and president = "Hindenburg"; sh_ban_timer = 6;
view-if: sh_banned == 0

[? if president == "Hindenburg": Banning the Stahlhelm weakens our relationship with President Hindenburg, as well as the political right and the police. ?][? if president != "Hindenburg": Banning the Stahlhelm weakens our relationship with the political right and the police. ?] [? if spd_in_government = 1 and in_grand_coalition = 1 and president = "Hindenburg" : It also weakens our coalition due to the influence of Hindenburg on the right wing of our coalition. ?] In addition, the Stahlhelm still operates out of public sight.

@unban_sh
view-if: sh_banned = 1
on-arrival: sh_banned = 0; sh_strength += 100

The Stahlhelm is no longer banned.


@ban_rfb
view-if: communist_coalition < 3 and rfb_banned = 0
on-arrival: kpd_relation -= 15; rfb_strength -= 50; rfb_banned = 1; communist_coalition -= 1; z_relation += 5; dvp_relation += 5; prussian_police_loyalty += 0.1; interior_police_loyalty += 0.1; kpd_coalition_dissent += 2;

The ban is enthusiastically carried out by the police, perhaps too enthusiastically. The Communists take this as one more reason why the Socialists are traitors to the left. However, the moderate and center-right parties approve, as do the police.

@unban_rfb
view-if: rfb_banned = 1
on-arrival: rfb_banned = 0; kpd_relation += 5; rfb_strength += 50; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.05; interior_police_loyalty -= 0.05

The Communist RFB is no longer banned.
