= Education and Science

Education in Germany is an area of mixed responsibility between the state governments and the central government. The Weimar Constitution claims that schools are the domain of the central government, but in practice much of it is left to the states, as the Reichstag has historically been unable to pass an education law. Currently, with our control of Prussia and the Chancellorship, we can try to set policy for a large part of the country.

@increase_science
title: Increase funding for scientific research.
choose-if: economic_minister_party = "SPD"
unavailable-subtitle: This requires the Economic Ministry.

Socialism has always stood for science and rationality. Despite the setbacks of the Great War, hyperinflation, and the politicized and reactionary attitudes of many academics, science in the German Republic is still the envy of the world. With a great expansion of funding, we hope to keep it that way, and expand on our achievements.

The Kaiser Wilhelm Society is one of the most respected scientific research institutions in the world, with physicist Albert Einstein as its most famous employee. Our research program is to provide the Society with additional resources to hire and train scientists and conduct fundamental research, based on the scientists' own interests.

@applied
title: Fund applied research in economically useful technologies.
subtitle: -1 budget
choose-if: budget >= 1
on-arrival: budget -= 1; science += 1; applied_research += 1; economic_growth += 0.5 if economic_growth <= 8 and applied_research <= 1; economic_growth += 3 if applied_research > 1; new_middle_spd += 5*(1-dissent); workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent); ddp_relation += 5*(1-dissent); unemployed -= 0.5 if unemployed >= 4; capital_strike_progress -= 1 if capital_strike_progress > 1; science_funding += 1

Our research program focuses on collaborating with industry to develop useful technologies, creating new research institutions for applied science. This collaboration is focused on economic growth and development.


@medical

Our research program focuses on medical research to improve the treatment of diseases and public health. [? if change_sex: Some of our medical advancements include new methods for sex change surgery and hormone therapy for transsexual individuals. ?]

@cut_funding
title: Cut science funding.
subtitle: +1 budget
choose-if: science_funding >= 1

We have cut funding for science. This has a negative effect on our economic growth, and unemployed scientists are less likely to support the SPD.


@structure
title: Change the structure and funding of education.

Education in Germany has traditionally been organized on religious and class lines. Schools are often either Protestant or Catholic (or rarely Jewish), and religious classes are required in most mixed-denomination schools. In addition, the working class has at most eight years of public education in primary and middle schools, while the middle and upper classes have access to private schools and Gymnasiums that prepare students for universities. Thus, the universities tend to be dominated by conservatives and reactionaries, which has negative consequences for bureaucratic recruitment.

Are you sure about this? The Weimar Coalition had an agreement to not touch religious schools; the Catholic Center Party will revolt.

The SPD, [+ ddp_name +], DVP, and KPD vote in favor of secular education, overcoming the opposition of the religiously-oriented Center Party and DNVP. We have funded secular community schools to replace some previous denominational schools.

[? if in_weimar_coalition or in_grand_coalition or in_popular_front or in_emergency_government: Of course, the Center Party is in revolt at this proposal, and have called for a vote of no confidence in our government. ?]

# this makes the bureaucracy more proletarian
We have funded more public secondary schools so that proletarian children may receive the same education as middle and upper-class children, and can be prepared for universities.

We have created local elected school boards, and delegated some of the decision-making for local schools to them.


@curriculum

choose-if: curriculum_timer = 0
unavailable-subtitle: [? if curriculum_timer > 0 : It is too early to change the curriculum again. ?][? if not spd_prussia: We are not in control of the Prussian state government. ?]

Many socialists believe that education in Germany is not fit for the modern era. Much of the educational system still follows imperial-era traditions of militaristic discipline, and far-right professors and students rule the universities. Nevertheless, there have been strides in bringing working-class children into the schools.

What should be the major focus of our new curriculum?

go-to: curriculum_minor

We should teach students how to be citizens of a democratic republic, by teaching them to critically evaluate politics and current events, to exercise their rights and to respect the rights of other citizens. Traditionalists of all stripes are critical of this curriculum.

@science_major
title: Scientific curriculum

go-to: curriculum_minor

Our educational system should reflect the modern age, and we should teach science and rational thinking. Religious conservatives tend to react negatively against this. 

@human_major

go-to: curriculum_minor

Our educational curriculum should be focused on the humanities, including arts, literature, history, and philosophy. Some criticize this curriculum as focusing too much on "useless" subjects, while others worry that the arts establishment is too closely tied to romantic nationalism.

Education should be focused on providing a useful hands-on education, and teach the skills that will be most useful for students' future lives.

The traditional curriculum had a focus on ancient history and language (particularly Latin and Greek), as well as rigid discipline and some level of militarism.
