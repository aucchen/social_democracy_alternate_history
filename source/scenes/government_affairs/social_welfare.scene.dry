= Social Welfare Policy

The social welfare program, including unemployment insurance, healthcare, and old-age care, is the proudest achievement of the SPD in our time in government. There is continuous pressure to dismantle the welfare system[? if black_thursday_seen = 1 :, especially given the economic crisis ?].

We have reduced levels of social welfare spending. This means more poverty and suffering for the working class. Our detractors claim that we are sacrificing proletarian livelihoods for the sake of class peace with the bourgeoisie. Are they wrong? Are the workers wrong to turn to the Communists, in light of our choices?

We have increased welfare spending. Our proletarian base is pleased.

Increasing welfare spending is necessary in light of the rise in unemployment, so we are essentially treading water.

We have kept welfare spending the same.

subtitle: The increased levels of unemployment necessitate more spending on aid.

Increasing welfare spending is necessary in light of the rise in unemployment, so we have essentially cut welfare. The workers are justifiably displeased - we are sacrificing their livelihoods to appease bourgeois demands for austerity.

[? if in_popular_front or in_left_front: The KPD is turning against us for our welfare policy. ?]
