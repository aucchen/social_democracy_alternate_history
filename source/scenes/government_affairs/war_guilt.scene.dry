= Reichstag War Guilt Inquiry

The War Guilt Inquiry has been an intermittent Reichstag committee for investigating the causes of the Great War and the German defeat. So far, it has faced massive resistance from the military establishment up to President Hindenburg.

- @restart: Restart the inquiry.

What is the goal of this tribunal?

- @pure_history: To provide a historical record of the events of the war.
- @rewrite: To revise the popular German histories and finally put to rest the "stabbed in the back" myth.

@pure_history

The history is being compiled, as it always has been.

Destroying the "stabbed in the back" myth, in addition to finally correcting the historical record, would do a great deal to improve our party's reputation. This is why it would be resisted by the military establishment every step of the way.
