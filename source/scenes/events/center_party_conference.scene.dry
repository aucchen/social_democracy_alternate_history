= Center Party Conference

Wilhelm Marx, former Center Party chancellor and presidential candidate, has chosen to resign from leadership of the Center Party. Now, the party holds a conference to replace him.

The consensus candidate on the right is Ludwig Kaas, a Catholic priest who represents the party's traditionalists. On the other hand, there is Joseph Joos, a leader of the Catholic trade unions, who has been more supportive of cooperation with the SPD than most of the Center Party.

- @kaas: The Center Party elects Ludwig Kaas as the party chair.
- @joos: Influence the Center Party to select Joseph Joos as the party chair.

@kaas
on-arrival: z_party_leader = "Kaas"; z_relation -= 5

Ludwig Kaas has been selected as the chairman of the Center Party. He seems to represent a rightward turn from Marx, and will preside over a Center Party less inclined to compromise with the left.

@joos
unavailable-subtitle: Our relations are not good enough.
subtitle: Joos is likely to be friendlier to us than Kaas.
choose-if: z_relation >= 70
on-arrival: z_party_leader = "Joos"

With our grassroots connections, we have been able to influence the Center delegates to support Joseph Joos as the new Center chairman. He has long been a friend of the SPD, and will be more inclined to collaborate with us compared to Kaas.
