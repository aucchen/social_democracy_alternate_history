= Emergency budget cuts

Due to the crisis of the Great Depression, government budgets have fallen and welfare spending has risen substantially. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has used Article 48 of the constitution in order to pass an emergency bill cutting welfare spending.

[? if spd_toleration : If we reject this, it would mean the end of the toleration agreement, and [+ chancellor +] would likely dissolve the Reichstag and call new elections. Of course, the workers are opposed to this policy, although it might be necessary for economic and political stability. ?]

on-arrival: welfare -= 1; unemployed += 2; unemployed_nsdap += 4; unemployed_kpd += 3; unemployed_spd += 2; pro_republic -= 4; budget += 1; inflation -= 2

The emergency policy passes under emergency rules, as the Reichstag is currently dissolved. The Nazis use this as a recruiting tool, and so do we.

on-arrival: time_to_election = 3; spd_in_government = 0; in_grand_coalition = 0; spd_toleration = 0; pro_republic -= 5
call: set_next_election_time

We have broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, and have voted against them in a vote of no confidence. Welfare has been saved, but at what cost?

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].


@vote_yes
title: Vote in favor of this measure to continue the toleration agreement.
view-if: spd_toleration
on-arrival: welfare -= 1; unemployed += 2; left_dissent += 10; labor_dissent += 10; workers_spd *= 0.9; unemployed_spd *= 0.9; unemployed_nsdap += 5; unemployed_kpd += 5; workers_nsdap += 5; workers_kpd += 5; workers_spd -= 4 if welfare < 0; unemployed_spd -= 5 if welfare < 0; pro_republic -= 4; kpd_relation -= 8; budget += 1; inflation -= 2

We try to convince the workers that this policy is necessary in order to maintain a stable parliamentary government, and to deal with the fiscal consequences of the depression. Still, this policy provides excellent recruiting fodder for Nazis and Communists.
