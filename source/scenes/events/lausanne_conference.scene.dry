= Lausanne Conference

At the Lausanne Conference, the Allies have met with Germany's representatives in order to deal with the issue of war reparations once and for all. In light of the current economic crisis, the Allies believe that Germany is unable to make the reparation payments.

Therefore, our reparations have been paused indefinitely! This should reduce the strain on our budget.
