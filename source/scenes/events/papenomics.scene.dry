= Papen's Economic Plan

Chancellor Franz von Papen and his "Cabinet of Barons" are pushing forward an economic plan consisting of tax cuts for the very wealthy. This plan has the potential to lead to more economic growth, especially in comparison to BrÃ¼ning's austerity program, but it also enriches the upper class and does nothing directly for the needy workers and unemployed.

- @root: The policy passes due to the emergency government; there is nothing we can do...
