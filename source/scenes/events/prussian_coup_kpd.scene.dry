= Coup in Prussia

Канцлер [+ chancellor +] has ordered the dismissal of the Prussian government in a procedure known as the *Reichsexecution*. His argument is that the Prussian state government is unable to maintain order due to the battles on the streets between the SA, Reichsbanner, and other paramilitaries. This is despite his own government legalizing them.

The legality of the action is questionable. Many of our members are ready to resist.

The Reichswehr and Stahlhelm are already surrounding the left-leaning cities, and the SA is supporting them. This will be civil war. We do realize that, correct?

- @defend_2: Civil war it is.

A pall of hopelessness and despair descends over social democracy. We have failed. Many in the Reichsbanner simply quit, demoralized by their leaders' lack of a call to action.
