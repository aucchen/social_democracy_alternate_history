= Coup in Prussia

A crisis! Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has ordered the dismissal of the Prussian government in a procedure known as the *Reichsexecution*. His argument is that the Prussian state government is unable to maintain order due to the battles on the streets between the SA, Reichsbanner, and other paramilitaries. This is despite his own government legalizing them.

The legality of the action is questionable. Many of our members are ready to resist.

subtitle: Labor will call a general strike. The Reichsbanner and the loyal elements of the Prussian police will resist the coup.
unavailable-subtitle: We do not have the forces to resist.
choose-if: rb_strength*rb_militancy >= 200

The Reichswehr and Stahlhelm are already surrounding Berlin, and the SA is supporting them. This could be civil war. We do realize that, correct? 

- @defend_2: We will fight, even if it leads to a civil war.

Our forces confront the government troops and their reactionary auxiliaries, and somehow, our enemies retreat without a fight! They were overwhelmed by our display of strength, and have chosen to slink away. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] withdraws the dismissal of the Prussian government, at least for now.

The show of force has reinvigorated support for the republic and for the SPD, and has weakened the fascists.

@defend_2_civil_war

Our forces confront the government troops and their supporters on the streets of Berlin, and armed fighting erupts. The reactionaries do not budge from their positions. We are caught at a disadvantage.

- @civil_war: It is a civil war.

A pall of hopelessness and despair descends over social democracy. We have failed. Many in the Reichsbanner simply quit, demoralized by their leaders' lack of a call to action.
