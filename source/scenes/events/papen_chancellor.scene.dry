President Hindenburg's secretive group of advisors (the camarilla) has turned against Brüning, and Hindenburg his dismissed the Chancellor, replacing him with the more reactionary Franz von Papen, an independent formerly of the Center Party. [? if year == 1932 : Brüning's final straw was his "agricultural settlement" policy, sending unemployed workers to homestead in underutilized lands (that happen to be owned by aristocrats). ?]

Papen is immediately faced with a vote of no confidence, given his unpopularity. However the SPD votes, he is guaranteed to fall, due to the unanimous hatred against him from all other parties. Meanwhile, he is governing via emergency powers with Hindenburg. His first policy is to legalize the Nazi SA, but this does not win their loyalty.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
