= KPD Goals

One year ago, the KPD presented a list of goals for the coalition:

[? if welfare_goal = 1 : - Expand social welfare programs - [? if welfare_goal_completed : success ?][? if not welfare_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if agriculture_goal = 1 : - Enact a land reform program. - [? if agriculture_goal_completed : success ?][? if not agriculture_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if economy_goal = 1 : - Start substantial nationalization of the economy. - [? if economy_goal_completed : success ?][? if not economy_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if finance_goal = 1 : - Make taxes more progressive. - [? if finance_goal_completed : success ?][? if not finance_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if labor_goal = 1 : - Support workers in labor disputes. - [? if labor_goal_completed : success ?][? if not labor_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if foreign_goal = 1 : - Improve our relations with the Soviet Union. - [? if foreign_goal_completed : success ?][? if not foreign_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if reichswehr_goal = 1 : - Reduce funding for the Reichswehr. - [? if reichswehr_goal_completed : success ?][? if not reichswehr_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

on-arrival: kpd_relation -= 10; workers_spd -= 8; unemployed_spd -= 8;

Unfortunately, we have failed to accomplish all of the goals the KPD set out. They plan to call a vote of no confidence against our government, and have already begun mounting a propaganda campaign to delegitimize our government in the eyes of the workers.

- @appeal: Appeal to the Communists to have patience - we are trying!
- @kpd_vote_of_no_confidence.support_center: Could we form a new government based on the Center Party and DDP (and possibly DVP)?
- @kpd_vote_of_no_confidence.let_it_happen: Let the vote happen.

unavailable-subtitle: [? if kpd_score < 4: They do not see us as serious in trying to achieve the goals of the coalition. ?] [? if kpd_relation < 50: Our relations are too poor. ?] [? if kpd_appeal_seen = 1: we do not have any more time. ?]
on-arrival: kpd_ultimatum_seen = 0; kpd_ultimatum_timer += 6; kpd_appeal_seen = 1

We argue that we have already achieved most of the coalition's goals, and in the name of proletarian solidarity, we must make this coalition function. Surprisingly, the KPD hears our pleas, and is willing to give us six more months before the coalition goals must be achieved.

Against all expectations, the KPD's goals have all been met! Apparently the Communists did not prepare for this eventuality, a worker's government successfully built through democratic means. They will continue to "tolerate" our government for the rest of our term, while still acting as a watchdog against bourgeois backsliding.
