= May Day, 1929

Tensions run high in Berlin. The Communists are planning a demonstration to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Spartacist Uprising. No one has forgotten that it was our party members who ordered the uprising's suppression, and the Communists still blame us for the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.

Many non-communists are afraid of the possibility of another violent uprising, and our allies in the Prussian coalition are asking the Prussian Interior Ministry to ban the demonstrations.

- @ban: Ban the demonstrations.
- @allow_police: Allow the demonstrations to proceed, but maintain a heavy police presence.
- @allow: Allow the demonstrations to proceed.
- @join: Join in the demonstrations ourselves.

We issued the order to ban the demonstrations, and sent police to enforce the ban. There was a confrontation between the police and Communists, and violence erupted. Reports say that the Berlin police killed dozens of demonstrators and innocent bystanders. The Communists are already calling this incident *Blutmai*, "Bloody May".

This may end any attempt at reconciliation with the KPD, but the Center and People's parties approve of our action.

- @corrupt_police: It is the fault of corrupt and reactionary elements within the police. Purge those responsible.
- @communist_fault: It is the fault of the Communists for refusing to follow the rule of law.
- @no_fault: It is an unfortunate incident that should not have happened, but is no one's fault at all.

We arrested the police responsible for the killings, and put them on trial. [? if judicial_reform = 0 : Unfortunately, the reactionary judiciary let them go free with barely any punishment at all. ?]

This assuages some of the Communists' outrage, but certainly not all.

If the KPD continues to act illegally, they must suffer the consequences. Thus, we have banned the RFKB, their paramilitary group. The bourgeois and right-leaning parties approve.

@no_fault

This position gains us no allies, and does not alienate anyone any further.


@allow_police
on-arrival: kpd_relation += 5; workers_kpd += 5; unemployed_kpd += 5

The demonstration proceeds peacefully under the watchful eyes of the police. Onlookers admire the strength of the Communist workers, and perhaps some of our supporters have been peeled off.


@allow

The demonstration proceeds peacefully, with a minimal police presence. Onlookers admire the strength of the Communist workers, and perhaps some of our members have been peeled off. The KPD will never admit it, but they are developing a less hostile view towards us (even if they do not *like* us yet). Our centrist allies denounce the demonstration, but their cries are ineffectual.

It is difficult to persuade the Communists to let us march with them, given the histories of their party and ours. However, they eventually relent. The display of proletarian unity inspires the workers and terrifies the bourgeoisie and middle class. [? if in_grand_coalition : Our coalition partners in the government are outraged at our display with the communists, and are threatening to break up the government. ?] The far-right paramilitaries increase their recruitment to counter us.
