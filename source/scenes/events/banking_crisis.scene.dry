= Banking Crisis

The DarmstÃ¤dter und Nationalbank, or Danat Bank, has collapsed! Along with it goes much of the German banking system. The cause seemed to be due to the government's pursuit of a customs union with Austria, which led to de facto international sanctions.

This is a bourgeois dispute, but the costs will be borne by the proletariat. The people are facing ever-increasing hunger and poverty, and perhaps we are partly to blame.

- @austerity: Chancellor [+ chancellor +]'s response is, as always, more austerity.
- @end_toleration: We are tired of austerity. End the toleration arrangement!

@austerity
on-arrival: welfare -= 1; workers_spd -= 3; unemployed_spd -= 3; pro_republic -= 3

Chancellor [+ chancellor +] responds to the banking crisis with more cuts to welfare.

We are tired of [+ chancellor +]'s policy of austerity. After [+ chancellor +]'s attempt to use emergency powers to pass another welfare cut, we have worked with the other parties to reverse this policy. In response, the Reichstag has been dissolved, and new elections called.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
