= The Array of Forces

Our enemies are the nationalist Stahlhelm, with [+ sh_strength +] thousand troops, and the Nazi SA, with [+ sa_strength +] thousand troops. The loyalties of the Reichswehr, with its [+ reichswehr_strength +] thousand regular soldiers, and Prussian police, with [+ prussian_police_strength +] thousand members, are unclear.

[? if chancellor_party == "KPD" or president == "Thälmann" : The KPD's paramilitary, the RFB, is leading the battle, and we are their co-combatants. ?]

On our side, we have the Reichsbanner, at [+ rb_strength +] thousand members. [? if dissent > 0.15 and dissent <= 0.25: It is somewhat weakened by dissent within the party, and some members choose not to fight. ?][? if dissent > 0.25 and dissent < 0.5: It is weakened by dissent within the party, and many members choose not to fight. ?][? if dissent >= 0.5: It is heavily weakened by dissent within the party, and a substantial portion of members choose not to fight. ?]

[? if rb_militancy < 0.25 : Unfortunately, the Reichsbanner are poorly trained and equipped, and will not be able to stand against our more militarized opponents. ?][? if rb_militancy >= 0.25 and rb_militancy < 0.5 : We have spent some resources training and equipping the Reichsbanner. Let us hope our people can persist. ?][? if rb_militancy >= 0.5 : We have spent quite a great deal of resources on turning the Reichsbanner into a fighting force. Let us hope that they survive. ?]

What else do we have?

- @kpd_help: Call for support from the Communists.
- @general_strike: Call a general strike!
- @loyal_police: Call up the loyal portions of the police.

We have urged the Reichswehr to stand down, to avoid killing their countrymen. [? if reichswehr_loyalty < 0.2 : Unfortunately, few heed our calls; the Reichswhere detest us. ?][? if reichswehr_loyalty >= 0.2 and reichswehr_loyalty < 0.4 : Some officers and troops heed our calls to not fight against us. Some even join us. ?][? if reichswehr_loyalty >= 0.4 and reichswehr_loyalty < 0.6 : The Reichswehr is split. Many avoid taking a side, or join our side. ?][? if reichswehr_loyalty >= 0.6 : Surprisingly, the majority of the Reichswehr is on our side! Our preparations have worked. ?]

There are [+ rfb_strength +] thousand fighters with the Communist RFB, in addition to the workers who support the KPD.

[? if kpd_relation >= 60 : The KPD is entirely on our side, owing to our good relations.. ?][? if kpd_relation < 60 and kpd_relation >= 45 : Most of the KPD is on our side, due to their good relations with us. ?][? if kpd_relation < 45 : The KPD does not support us. ?]

A general strike stopped the Kapp Putsch in 1920, and it can stop fascism today. [? if normalized_workers_total > 70 : The workers are largely united with us. ?][? if normalized_workers_total >= 50 and normalized_workers_total <= 70 : There is some dissent within labor, but a majority of workers support the general strike. ?][? if normalized_workers_total > 30 and normalized_workers_total < 50 : However, there is substantial dissent within labor, and less than half support the general strike. ?][? if normalized_workers_total <= 30 : However, labor is deeply divided, and most workers do not heed the call to strike. ?]

Since we still control the Prussian government, we can call upon the Prussian police.

Our efforts in cultivating republican loyalties in the police have proven their worth. ?]

@defeat

= Total Defeat

Our forces are no match for those of the reactionaries. Reichsbanner fighters are quickly overpowered by the forces of the Stahlhelm, SA, and Reichswehr. Many are killed before the rest surrender. Our remaining leaders flee the country or face execution, as the reactionaries take absolute power over Germany.

Our resistance will be recorded in the history books, and in the future, our names will be honored. But for now, all is lost.

- @game_over: Game over.

@long_war
go-to: long_war_intervention if resist_coup == 0; game_over_menu if resist_coup == 1

= Long War

The initial phase of the action ends, and somehow, both sides remain standing.

The war settles into fixed battle lines. This will not be a quick coup, but a long civil war. The nation will destroy itself before it can be rebuilt again.

@game_over_menu

While we might want to call for foreign assistance, the foreign powers see the "Prussian Coup" as a purely internal matter.

- @game_over

# no war

@long_war_intervention

- @west_aid: Perhaps we can receive aid from the Western powers, France and Britain.
- @soviet_aid: Perhaps we can receive aid from the Soviet Union.
- @east_aid: Perhaps our eastern neighbors, Poland and Czechoslovakia, can help us. If they know anything, they do not want fascists coming to power in Germany.
- @game_over: Game over.

We send a call for help to the West, but their governments are divided on whether or not to support us. We have to survive on our own until they make a decision.

go-to: long_war_intervention

We send a call for help to the Soviet Union. The KPD receives the bulk of the aid, while the Reichsbanner and our loyal military units are left floundering. If we win, this does not bode well for our future.

@east_aid
choose-if: east_relation >= 2

max-visits: 1
go-to: long_war_intervention

Poland and Czechoslovakia are largely too absorbed in their own problems to be of much help, but weapons and volunteers filter through the parts of the borders that we control.

@republic_victory

= Victory for the Republic

The battle lines hold, and the SA, Stahlhelm, and pro-coup Reichswehr forces are defeated. Today, the forces of the republic prevail over the fascists and the reactionaries. There is a new revolution in Germany. Let us hope it produces a longer-lasting peace than the previous one.

- @game_over: Game over.
