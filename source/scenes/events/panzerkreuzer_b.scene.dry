= Panzerkreuzer B

The Navy is demanding the construction of another new battlecruiser. [? if panzerkreuzer_funded: The previous battlecruiser had been funded, and has already been launched. Another ship would futher progress Germany's rearmament. ?][? if not panzerkreuzer_funded: The previous battlecruiser requested by the Navy was not funded, thanks to us. The military remains bitter, but nevertheless they are still pursuing their rearmament plan, and must seek funding from the Reichstag. ?]

Much of our party is deeply opposed to rearmament, while the center and right parties are united in support. What will we do?

- @vote_yes: Vote yes, for constructing the battlecruiser.
- @vote_no: Vote no, against constructing the battlecruiser.
- @abstain: Abstain from the vote.
- @ministry: Use the Reichswehr Ministry to prevent the construction.

Our grassroots party members are highly critical of our decision. Many party branches have increased their agitation against our parliamentary fraction. [? if panzerkreuzer_funded : However, given the construction of the previous battlecruiser, this seemed to be a foregone conclusion, and the reaction is muted. ?]

The vote in favor of the battlecruiser easily passes, with opposition only from the KPD. The ship will be built.

go-to: built if spd_r + kpd_r + ddp_r < 50; not_built if spd_r + kpd_r + ddp_r >= 50

Our vote against the battlecruiser is unpopular among the right-wing parties[? if in_grand_coalition or in_weimar_coalition: , including our coalition partners ?][? if spd_toleration: , including the minority government that we are currently supporting ?].

@abstain
on-arrival: dvp_relation -= 5; z_relation -= 3; left_dissent += 5; labor_dissent += 5 if not panzerkreuzer_funded; panzerkreuzer_b_funded = 1; kpd_relation -= 3

The center-right parties are critical of our decision to abstain, and the pressure from our left flank is not entirely assuaged. Despite our abstention, the vote in the Reichstag passes, with all parties in favor except the SPD and KPD. The ship will be built.

@built
on-arrival: panzerkreuzer_b_funded = 1

Chancellor [+ chancellor +] brings the matter to a full Reichstag vote, which passes with all parties in favor except the SPD and KPD. The ship will be built.

@not_built
on-arrival: panzerkreuzer_b_funded = 0; budget += 1 if panzerkreuzer_funded = 0

Our vote against the battlecruiser succeeds, with the support of the KPD and anti-war portions of the former DDP. The ship will not be built! [? if panzerkreuzer_funded == 0 : We have saved some budget from not funding the two ships. ?]

@ministry
on-arrival: panzerkreuzer_b_funded = 0; budget += 1 if panzerkreuzer_funded = 0
view-if: reichswehr_minister_party == "SPD"

With our control of the Reichswehr Ministry, we have pressured the Navy to abandon its rearmament plans. The ship will not be built. [? if panzerkreuzer_funded == 0 : We have saved some budget from not funding the two ships. ?]
