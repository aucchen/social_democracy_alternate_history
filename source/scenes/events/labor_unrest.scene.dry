= Labor Unrest

The mining and metals industry of the Ruhr region is beset by a wave of strikes against cuts to wages and benefits. Meanwhile, employers have started a retaliatory lockout to force their workers to accept these cuts. Both the strikers and the employers look to the SPD in the government to resolve this crisis.

- @support_labor: Support labor in their demands.
- @support_employers: Support the employers in their demands.
- @balance: Try to strike a compromise between the sides.

Supporting labor is always popular in the SPD, although many of our coalition partners represent employers, and they are less enthused.

Even though most workers grudgingly accept the our intervention, there is deep bitterness developing against the SPD, especially among the more radical workers. The Communists stand to gain.

@balance
subtitle: Both sides need to share the pain in the current crisis.
on-arrival: labor_dissent += 4; workers_spd -= 2; kpd_coalition_dissent += 1; kpd_relation -= 5; workers_kpd += 2

Many workers are unhappy at our compromises, but they will learn to accept that we are all in a shared struggle against economic forces. This is perhaps the best we could do given the present circumstances.
