= March on Berlin

The far right is mobilizing. Paramilitary forces of the Stahlhelm and SA, organized under the Harzburg Front, have marched on Berlin, threatening to violently overthrow the government.

They demand either immediate elections under the "supervision" of the nationalist paramilitaries, or else the immediate resignation of the government and the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor[? if hitler_deported : , and the revocation of his deportation ?]. It is obvious that they are threatening a civil war if their demands are not met.

@non_govt_menu

It appears that President [+ president +] is looking favorably upon the fascist proposals. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has announced plans to resign.

President [+ president +] has called for emergency elections, to be held next month, under a caretaker government. The SA is permitted to act with impunity, intimidating voters into supporting the fascists.

Our forces confront the fascists, and somehow, the fascists retreat! They were overwhelmed by our display of strength, and have chosen to slink away. The attempted coup is over, at least for now.

The show of force has reinvigorated support for the republic and for the SPD, and has weakened the fascists.


@fight_2_pre_civil_war

Our forces confront the fascists on the streets of Berlin, and fighting erupts. Neither side is dislodged from their positions.

- @civil_war: It is a civil war.

The courts agree that President [+ president +] is wrong to dismiss us, and that we should remin in the government. The President might respect the court's decision for now, but the fascists in the streets do not. They are still demanding snap elections or the resignation of the government, and will remain in the streets until we either meet their demands, or they are forced out.

@new_elections_braun_reject

The fascists reject our offer of free and fair elections. They are demanding that President [+ president +] dismisses the current government and appoints Hitler chancellor.

@new_elections_braun_2
go-to: new_elections_2

The fascists seem to believe that they would win an election if one were to be held now, so they agree to our holding an election for next month.


@new_elections_hindenburg
go-to: new_elections_2

With the mediation of various establishment figures, new elections are called for next month, without the use of fascist "electoral monitors".

@new_elections_hindenburg_reject

Influenced by his inner circle and by the fascists in the streets, President Hindenburg rejects our offer of new free and fair elections, and again demands that we resign. There is no arguing.
