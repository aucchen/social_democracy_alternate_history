= Vote of No Confidence

[? if in_grand_coalition : The DVP ?][? if in_weimar_coalition or in_popular_front: The Center Party ?] has called for a vote of no confidence against us, due to our various policies and disagreements. If this succeeds, there will be an election in a few months.

- @try_assuage: Try to assuage our partners.
- @support_kpd: Could we get the KPD to abstain?
- @let_it_happen: Let the vote happen.

@try_assuage

How do we assuage our partners?

- @give_up_prussia: Give up on leadership of Prussia.
- @austerity: Enact a massive austerity plan.
- @resources: Use our resources to reduce dissent within the coalition.
- @support_kpd: Could we get the KPD to abstain?
- @let_it_happen: Never mind. Let the vote happen.

@give_up_prussia
view-if: spd_prussia == 1
on-arrival: coalition_dissent = 0; spd_prussia = 0; prussian_government = "I"; reformist_dissent += 10; centrist_dissent += 10; labor_dissent += 10; left_dissent += 5; workers_spd -= 5; rural_spd -= 5; 

Fine. We no longer control the government of Prussia. The vote has been called off.

@austerity
view-if: welfare >= 0
on-arrival: coalition_dissent = 0; workers_spd -= 10; umemployed_spd -= 10; workers_kpd += 7; workers_nsdap += 3; unemployed_kpd += 5; unemployed_nsdap += 5; left_dissent += 15; center_dissent += 10; labor_dissent += 15; reformist_dissent += 5; welfare -= 2; budget += 1; unemployed += 3

Fine. We enacted a massive austerity program to cut welfare, in order to maintain the stability of our coalition. The vote has been called off.

@resources
choose-if: resources >= 3
unavailable-subtitle: We do not have enough resources.
subtitle: -3 resources
on-arrival: resources -= 3; coalition_dissent -= 1;

By transferring resources to our coalition partners, we can reduce their dissent against our policies. This is a crude, but effective solution.

@support_kpd
choose-if: (in_grand_coalition and communist_coalition >= 3 and kpd_relation >= 50 and kpd_r >= dvp_r) or (in_weimar_coalition and kpd_relation >= 50 and kpd_r >= z_r and communist_coalition >= 3)
unavailable-subtitle: [? if communist_coalition < 3 : The KPD won't take part in parliamentary government. ?] [? if kpd_relation < 50 : The KPD is not friendly enough with us. ?] [? if (in_grand_coalition and kpd_r < dvp_r) or (in_weimar_coalition and kpd_r < z_r): The KPD does not have enough votes. ?] [? if in_popular_front : We are already in a Popular Front with the KPD. ?]

If the Communists abstain, then we essentially can maintain a minority government[? if president=="Hindenburg":, although it would be very difficult to make policy without the support of President Hindenburg, which we do not have ?]. If this happens, then we will own a massive debt to the KPD. This could lead to broader cooperation in the future, for better or for worse.

- @support_kpd_2: Persuade the KPD to "tolerate" us?
- @let_it_happen: Never mind. Let the vote happen.

@support_kpd_2
on-arrival: communist_coalition += 1; workers_kpd += 3; kpd_relation += 5
go-to: support_kpd_weimar if in_weimar_coalition; support_kpd_grand if in_grand_coalition

The KPD is not interested in a "toleration" arrangement; they will only support us if they can participate in the government as part of a coalition. And, if this toleration agreement happens, the right-wing parties will not be inclined to support us. 

@support_kpd_grand

- @election_1928.popular_front_coalition: Form a "Popular Front" coalition?
- @election_1928.left_coalition
- @try_assuage: Never mind. We must deal with this some other way.

The vote succeeds, and our government has resigned. Chancellor Brüning has been appointed as the head of an acting government, consisting solely of the bourgeois parties. He immediately proceeds to cut welfare spending substantially.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
