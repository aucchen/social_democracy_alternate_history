= Hitler Appointed Chancellor!

Internal scheming by the camarilla surrounding the president has caused President Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor, replacing the unpopular [+ chancellor +]. [? if hitler_deported : Despite his earlier deportation, the Nazi leaders and their reactionary allies have connived for the president to give him German citizenship after all. ?] Some of the reactionaries surrounding Hindenburg believe that he will restore Germany to its supposed former glory, while others believe that they can control him and his movement.

He has promised a campaign of revenge against the socialists, and the Nazis have already spilled blood. In his published manifesto, he promises a campaign of unspeakable horror against Jews, and endless wars of violent expansion that will ruin all of Europe.

What are we to do now?

- @fight: We will fight on the streets to prevent Hitler from taking power.
- @give_up: We will vote against the nazis in the Reichstag.

Do we realize that this means civil war, against the full force of the state?

- @civil_war: Yes.
- @give_up: We are not ready for war. Instead, we will vote against the nazis in the Reichstag.

@give_up

Speeches are made. Votes are held. Bullets fly in the streets. Some socialists are killed or jailed. Others flee the country. What can votes even do at this juncture?

The Reichstag is burned, ostensibly by a foreign communist. In the wake, the Nazis pass decrees giving them unlimited power. They, combined with the DNVP, will win a majority at the next elections.

Germany is lost.

Мы приветствовали назначение нового канцлера. Будем надеятся, что наши планы о том, что нацисты дискредитируют себя в глазах рабочих оправдаются - пока что дискредитировали себя в их глазах лишь мы сами.
