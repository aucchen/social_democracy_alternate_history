v0.5:


v0.6:


v0.7:

Major changes:

- New advisors: Antonie Pfülf (reformist), Julius Leber (neorevisionist), Kurt Rosenfeld (left)
- New events: All Quiet on the Western Front, Altona Clashes
- New party affairs card: Building a People's Party
- New government affairs cards: Homosexual Rights, Agricultural Policy (plus an Agriculture Minister position).

Minor changes:

- Can return cards to the hand on easy/normal difficulties.
- If a vote of no confidence is held when new elections are happening in less 3 months, don't delay the elections.
- New advisor actions: End toleration (for some left advisors)
- Added descriptions of the internal party factions.
- Some more tax options.
- Abortion rights and homosexual rights can be passed with a "progressive coalition" of the SPD, KPD, and DDP.
- Can only use the Shuffle Cabinet and Women's Rights cards if the chancellor is SPD.
- Low relations with the DVP results in less leverage in a grand coalition.
- Papen being appointed as chancellor reduces judicial reform.
- Changed frequencies of some cards.

Future changes:

- Move end date to later in 1933.
- Government Affairs: Economic Democracy (labor + economy ministries), Left-wing economic crisis response (pursue nationalizations), Further investigate SA/SH/RFB after banning.
- More tax/tariff policy options
- A history page, showing a history of your actions.
- Increase hand size to 4 (at least for easy difficulty)

v0.8:

Major changes:

- Achievements! These can be seen after finishing a game.

Minor changes:

- Updated in-game credits to be the same as the credits.txt files.
- Taking no action on Easy difficulty on some Party Affairs cards should not advance the clock.
- Various bugfixes.
- Minor balancing changes (reduced difficulty of forming a people's party, supporting reformist ideology increases relations with bourgeois parties).

Future changes:

- I didn't get to any of the future changes listed in the previous update, so all of those are carrying over.
- For the post-1933 update, coups can be initiated in 1933 if the SPD is in power and is unpopular.
- Add ability to break toleration without using a event or advisor action.


v0.9 - government updates:

Major changes:

- New government affairs card: Economic Democracy (labor + economy/finance ministries). New advisor action for Hilferding.
- New events: March on Berlin, Capital Strike.
- New options: Left economic plan for the transformation of the economy (mass nationalizations), advisor actions to support the Left economic plan (Sender, Aufhäuser)
- New achievements: Räterepublik, Polykrise
- Ending of the game is set to May 1933.
- Changed the demographic system somewhat - previously, raising support in one demographic could increase total support beyond that demographic's numbers. This made working-class support more powerful compared to its actual proportion of the population. This is no longer possible. To compensate, it is now easier to increase support among the unemployed and other demographics.

Minor changes:

- a variety of bugfixes and frequency changes

Future changes:

- Government with the popular front without civil war is possible (but might have votes of no confidence from both the right and the left, and a higher likelihood of right-wing coups).
- "Historical" difficulty that constrains SPD actions to be more historically accurate.
- Record of previous actions in the library
- Tariffs
- Investigating paramilitaries after banning.
- Figure out which music/images is *actually* public domain
- Build executables that can be played on desktop, possibly an android apk.

Potential changes/ideas:

- Communist revolt
- moderate stimulus plan


v0.10 - Popular Front

Major changes:

- Governments with the Popular Front or Left Front (United Front/Einheitsfront) are possible without civil war. The Communists will have specific policy demands, and may call votes of no confidence. Popular Front governments will have dissent from both the left and the right.
- Can delay elections under emergency/presidential rule.

Minor changes:

- A whole bunch of bug fixes (thanks to everyone who commented!)
- People's Party now improves Catholic vote share, and enables campaigning among Catholics.
- Coup progress adjusted for various events.

New Achievements:

- Sieg für die Einheitsfront, Sieg für die Volksfront - successfully carry out the policies of the United Front/Popular Front.
- Ausnahmezustand - use emergency powers to cancel elections.
- Drei Pfeile - defeat a coup attempt without a civil war.

Potential future changes:

- Extend end date to the end of 1933.
- Historical mode: no saving/loading, and lots of adjusted thresholds and parameters.
- New advisor actions: Christian Socialism (Mierendorff)
- Other than that, I have most of the content I want in this game already. It just needs some polishing.

Notes on the Popular Front:

I don't know how the KPD would contend themselves in government. A KPD that is willing to support an SPD government would necessarily be different from Thälmann's Stalinist organization, so I looked to the earlier Paul Levi KPD as well as the French Popular Front for ideas. Originally I had the KPD ministers implementing certain policies, but reading about Paul Levi, I think that the KPD would be abstentionist in government, in that they would not have any ministers to preserve their independent course of action, and disavow themselves from any unpopular course the government may take. 

Ironically the hypothetical KPD position towards the Popular Front is basically analogous to the SPD position towards the Brüning government (i.e. toleration).
