v0.5:


v0.6:


v0.7:

Major changes:

- New advisors: Antonie Pfülf (reformist), Julius Leber (neorevisionist), Kurt Rosenfeld (left)
- New events: All Quiet on the Western Front, Altona Clashes
- New party affairs card: Building a People's Party
- New government affairs cards: Homosexual Rights, Agricultural Policy (plus an Agriculture Minister position).

Minor changes:

- Can return cards to the hand on easy/normal difficulties.
- If a vote of no confidence is held when new elections are happening in less 3 months, don't delay the elections.
- New advisor actions: End toleration (for some left advisors)
- Added descriptions of the internal party factions.
- Some more tax options.
- Abortion rights and homosexual rights can be passed with a "progressive coalition" of the SPD, KPD, and DDP.
- Can only use the Shuffle Cabinet and Women's Rights cards if the chancellor is SPD.
- Low relations with the DVP results in less leverage in a grand coalition.
- Papen being appointed as chancellor reduces judicial reform.
- Changed frequencies of some cards.

Future changes:

- Move end date to later in 1933.
- Government Affairs: Economic Democracy (labor + economy ministries), Left-wing economic crisis response (pursue nationalizations), Further investigate SA/SH/RFB after banning.
- More tax/tariff policy options
- A history page, showing a history of your actions.
- Increase hand size to 4 (at least for easy difficulty)

v0.8:

Major changes:

- Achievements! These can be seen after finishing a game.

Minor changes:

- Updated in-game credits to be the same as the credits.txt files.
- Taking no action on Easy difficulty on some Party Affairs cards should not advance the clock.
- Various bugfixes.
- Minor balancing changes (reduced difficulty of forming a people's party, supporting reformist ideology increases relations with bourgeois parties).

Future changes:

- I didn't get to any of the future changes listed in the previous update, so all of those are carrying over.
- For the post-1933 update, coups can be initiated in 1933 if the SPD is in power and is unpopular.
- Add ability to break toleration without using a event or advisor action.


v0.9 - government updates:

Major changes:

- New government affairs card: Economic Democracy (labor + economy/finance ministries). New advisor action for Hilferding.
- New events: March on Berlin, Capital Strike.
- New options: Left economic plan for the transformation of the economy (mass nationalizations), advisor actions to support the Left economic plan (Sender, Aufhäuser)
- New achievements: Räterepublik, Polykrise
- Ending of the game is set to May 1933.
- Changed the demographic system somewhat - previously, raising support in one demographic could increase total support beyond that demographic's numbers. This made working-class support more powerful compared to its actual proportion of the population. This is no longer possible. To compensate, it is now easier to increase support among the unemployed and other demographics.

Minor changes:

- a variety of bugfixes and frequency changes

Future changes:

- Government with the popular front without civil war is possible (but might have votes of no confidence from both the right and the left, and a higher likelihood of right-wing coups).
- "Historical" difficulty that constrains SPD actions to be more historically accurate.
- Record of previous actions in the library
- Tariffs
- Investigating paramilitaries after banning.
- Figure out which music/images is *actually* public domain
- Build executables that can be played on desktop, possibly an android apk.

Potential changes/ideas:

- Communist revolt
- moderate stimulus plan


v0.10 - Popular Front

Major changes:

- Governments with the Popular Front or Left Front (United Front/Einheitsfront) are possible without civil war. The Communists will have specific policy demands, and may call votes of no confidence. Popular Front governments will have dissent from both the left and the right.
- Can delay elections under emergency/presidential rule.

Minor changes:

- A whole bunch of bug fixes (thanks to everyone who commented!)
- People's Party now improves Catholic vote share, and enables campaigning among Catholics.
- Coup progress adjusted for various events.

New Achievements:

- Sieg für die Einheitsfront, Sieg für die Volksfront - successfully carry out the policies of the United Front/Popular Front.
- Ausnahmezustand - use emergency powers to cancel elections.
- Drei Pfeile - defeat a coup attempt without a civil war.

Potential future changes:

- Extend end date to the end of 1933.
- Historical mode: no saving/loading, and lots of adjusted thresholds and parameters.
- New advisor actions: Christian Socialism (Mierendorff)
- Other than that, I have most of the content I want in this game already. It just needs some polishing.

Notes on the Popular Front:

I don't know how the KPD would contend themselves in government. A KPD that is willing to support an SPD government would necessarily be different from Thälmann's Stalinist organization, so I looked to the earlier Paul Levi KPD as well as the French Popular Front for ideas. Originally I had the KPD ministers implementing certain policies, but reading about Paul Levi, I think that the KPD would be abstentionist in government, in that they would not have any ministers to preserve their independent course of action, and disavow themselves from any unpopular course the government may take. 

Ironically the hypothetical KPD position towards the Popular Front is basically analogous to the SPD position towards the Brüning government (i.e. toleration).

Major changes:

- Ending date is set to December 1933 
- New events: Businesses Lose Confidence (capital strike progress), Global Economic Recovery (middle of 1933), Nazis in Crisis (late 1933)
- New options to further persecute SA/Stahlhelm/RFB after banning them

Other changes:

v0.12.1 - Economics changes, bug fixes

Changes:

- Fixed issue with Wels' clearing the agenda on Easy
- Added a "limited budget" option for the reformist economic plan
- WTB-plan now costs 4 resources for the first iteration, but can be decreased to 3 by pro-labor policies or existing socializations.

Election results will now show a parliament diagram visualization, and there is a "Figures and charts" option in the library that will also show an electoral history chart. The parliament visualizations are created using the [d3-parliament](https://github.com/geoffreybr/d3-parliament) library, and the electoral history graphs are made using d3.

Future plans:
- See previous posts...

- Working on features for Steam release

Known issue- the election results won't exactly sum to 100 because of rounding. I'm not sure if having more decimal places would work well, though - even if we truncate the numbers to one decimal place, there will be terrible floating point issues that make any derived numbers look ugly. I'm still thinking of how to deal with that problem (probably a display layer that truncates the decimal places?).

Would you prefer to see more decimal places in the election results?

v0.14 - Foreign Affairs

Major changes:

- Added visualization for party support history.
- New events: Austrian Customs Union, Hoover Moratorium, Lausanne Conference. Also changed the requirements of the Banking Crisis.
- New party affairs card: Party Disunity
- New options for Foreign Affairs: splitting up Western Allies and eastern neighbors, forming an Austrian Customs Union, creating a European Union
- New advisor: Kurt Schumacher (neorevisionist)
- New achievement: Vereinigte Staaten von Europa

Minor changes:

- For most advisors, advisor actions should not reset the card timer.
- Typographical fixes
- Party faction strengths should sum to 100.

It is unlikely that there will be updates in August, as I work on my entries for IFComp 2024. I submitted intents for two entries, but I feel like there's a less than 50% chance I'll manage to complete one game. I'm also writing a postmortem for this game, which will *hopefully* be out soon-ish.

v0.14.2 - Heidelberg Program, bug fixes, minority government

Changes:

- New achievement: Heidelberger Programm (fulfill most of the historical goals of the Heidelberg Program)
- New achievement: Minderheitsregierung (successfully form an SPD minority government)
- Minority/emergency governments can get votes of no confidence.

- new category of advisors - non-factional. New advisors: Magnus Hirschfeld, Gustav Radbruch, Fritz Baade, Friedrich Stampfer.
- New advisor: Max Seydewitz (left)
- New advisor actions: Fiscal Policy (Hilferding). Now, all cabinet ministry actions should have a corresponding advisor action (Economic Ministry is Woytinsky's action).
- New event: Center Party Conference of December 1928 - if relations with the Center Party are strong enough, then it's possible to support Joseph Joos as party leader in place of Ludwig Kaas. This unlocks additional government options.
- New government options: National Unity Government under Joseph Wirth (see previous) - this is basically a Constitutional Coalition.
- New foreign ministry option - negotiate a Reichskonkordat with the Vatican.

- Each constitutional reform can only be done once.
- The Concordat can only be signed once.
- The Constitutional Reform card can now be drawn from the Government Affairs deck.
- Constitutional reform party support is based on Z without BVP.
- Changes in party votes should be accurately reflected when there is an electoral threshold.
- On the electoral threshold reform, it is mentioned that a plurality in an electoral district would bypass the threshold requirement, so that the BVP can remain.
- Radio is somewhat less effective later in the game.
- Changes to KPD coalition events if a constructive VONC reform is passed.


v0.17 - Conciliators and the SAPD

Major changes:
- The SAPD is introduced as a new party that receives Reichstag seats when both the Left and Center resign.
- Internal manipulations of the KPD - scheming can allow the Conciliator faction to take over the KPD, making the party more friendly to the SPD and coalitions. This is a chain of events beginning with the Wittorf Affair, a scandal involving Ernst Thälmann of the KPD, as well as foreign relations with the Soviet Union.
- New achievements: Versöhnler - have the conciliators take over the KPD; Große Volksfront - form a Popular Front with both Joos as Zentrum leader and the Conciliators as the KPD leaders; Katholischer Sozialismus - have over 50% support from Catholics.
- Added two new pieces of music.
- In order to build relations with the KPD, the SPD might have to face a reckoning with its own history.
- A right-wing coalition in 1928 is possible.

- Displaying KPD coalition dissent when the KPD is in the coalition.
- More SAPD vote share displays in the polls.

v0.18 - Event images, mod loader

Major changes:
- Event images are added! These are currently disabled by default, but can be enabled in the options menu. I find that while playing online, there's a bit of lag in loading the images, so they're disabled by default for now, but they should look better in one of the downloaded versions.
- Mod loader: This uses the target mod's `game.json` file, and the base game's music and images.
- Curated mod list: If you want to add a mod, send a pull request adding a line to `mod_list.tsv` at https://github.com/aucchen/social_democracy_mods.

Minor changes:

Changes:

- Changing some of the default names and party assignments for the Weimar Coalition, so that you don't get DVP ministers.

- When loading a mod, the game title and author are set to the title and author of the mod.
- Conciliators are no longer disabled in historical mode.
- There is a new hidden variable, "strife", that increases when there is streetfighting or other conflict. It doesn't have a lot of uses yet...


v0.19 - Labor rights and unemployment insurance, more gradual support changes

Major changes:
- New government affairs card: Labor Rights
- The unemployment insurance crisis can be handled preemptively using Labor Rights. In general, some of the flow around unemployment insurance has been changed.
- New advisor: Rudolf Wissell (labor)
- Party support changes are now more gradual, happening monthly instead of always at the start of the year. There are some tweaks to party support, with more support from middle-class and rural demographics flowing from Others and the DVP to the NSDAP to better account for historical election results.
